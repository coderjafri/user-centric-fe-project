            <p><strong>Nicknamed "King of Swing", Wasim Akram needs no introduction as he is arguably the best left arm fast
                bowler to have ever played the game of cricket. He was known to be a master a swinging the ball in both 
                directions and especially dangerous when the ball started to reverse.</strong>

            <h2>Vivian Richards - Batting Coach</h2>
            <p><strong>Nicknamed "Master Blaster", Vivian Richards was probably the most feared batsman of all time as he was
                an aggressive batsman who would take on any bowler in the world. Imran Khan has said that Vivian Richards presence
                at the crease would intimidate him.</strong>

            <h2>Shane Warne - Spin Coach</h2>
            <p><strong>First known for the "Gatting ball" where he bowled one of the best deliveries a batsman has ever faced. The best spinner
                to have ever played cricket, period. A massive spinner of the cricket ball, well known for his cricket brain and how 
                he would set batsman up for failure.</strong>
